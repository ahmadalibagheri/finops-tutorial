Hi there. 
today we want to talk about a cultural functions witch help us to optimize our infrastructure .

How check the current resource utilization?

first you need to have a csv file to write all the resource and usage. 

- resource name 
- ip 
- reason of use  
- resource department
-  avg RAM Usage (9 months )
-  avg RAM Usage (6 months )
-  avg RAM Usage (3 months )
-  Max RAM usage and why (9 months) in two cells
-  avg cpu Usage (9 months )
-  avg cpu Usage (6 months )
-  avg cpu Usage (3 months )
-  Max cpu usage and why (9 months)

- CPU of the resource 
- Ram of the resource 




Now you can find out which resource has chosen correctly and decide to change it or not! 
you can find all the information about the resources in your monitoring application.
